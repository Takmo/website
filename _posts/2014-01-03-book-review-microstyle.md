First of all, I should point out that this may not be much of a
review per se. Rather, I finished reading the book and thought
I might share my feelings on it.

_"Microstyle: The Art of Writing Little" by Christopher Johnson_

Originally, I had picked this book up under the recommendation
of a worker at the local(ish) B&N. I had asked about books that
might help improve my writing skills and, after a bit of head
scratching, they recommended this book. Rather embarrassingly,
the book sat on my bedside pile collecting dust for a few months
before I managed to find the time to start reading. When I finally
began, I progressed slowly, although not by any fault of the text,
I assure you. On the contrary, even though my schedule did not
permit an abundance of reading time, I definitely enjoyed the book.

Microstyle is about communicating with as few words as possible.
To clarify, it is not about eliminating content, it is about
condensing and strengthening the message. Usage cases include
mottos, slogans, titles, status updates, and anything where
a short message is preferred or required. Any time a short
message is necessary, it can likely be enhanced using microstyle.

In his book, Johnson explores microstyle by investigating its
common approaches. Each chapter focuses upon one particular element
of microstyle. From examining sentence structure to explaining
wordplay, each chapter presents an additional tool that wordsmiths
take advantage of while writing. While presenting each tool, Johnson
provides numerous examples, easily communicating his intentions in a
straightforward and often entertaining style. Despite the amount of
information being delivered, most chapters are surprisingly short
and to the point, allowing for an easy read, much to my enjoyment.

As a whole, the book is filled with a trove of information, although
it may not go into as much detail as some might prefer. The book's
single most important objective is to open the reader's eyes to the
world of microstyle and encourage them to consider the messages they
receive and convey everyday. With that in mind, I would say that
the book does a great job of accomplishing this goal. Microstyle
certainly is not the apex of linguistics, but it serves as a solid
introduction to the world of microstyle and provides you with a
practical base for experimenting with economical language.

After all is said and done, I enjoyed reading this book. More
importantly, it taught me useful, applicable lessons about
language that I can apply to everyday life. Additionally, it
managed to spark an interest in linguistics in the back of my
mind. Given the nature of the book, I am uncertain if I would
recommend this as reading material to my close friends, but
I would definitely lend my book to anyone interested in
improving their brief communications.

Final thoughts: If you are looking for the ultimate book on
linguistics, communication, or writing, keep looking. But if you
want a solid, straightforward, and entertaining introduction to
economical communication, you simply cannot go wrong with Microstyle.
