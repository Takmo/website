The dim fluorescent lights in the rafters were just beginning
to flicker to life, leaving the gymnasium half-draped in
shadows. A few teens were scattered throughout the bleachers,
the designated holding area for students prior to the first
period bell. Blue lights glowed from the laps of some, while
others slept in the shadows with their hoods pulled over
their faces. Not one of the handful of early arrivers seemed
eager to return to school after the coldest fall break on
record. Vacant expressions stared across the court towards
matching faces in the shadows. The early morning seemed to
condemn students back to the monotony, drama, hilights, and
horrors of high school.

It was 7:30am and Sky was just shuffling into the gym.
Being a senior, he was one of the few privileged with the
ability to drive to school. As his eyes adjusted to the shadows,
he compared himself against the other students in the room.
The dark colors beneath his green eyes, the weight resting
upon his eyelids, and his hopelessly tangled black hair left
him standing in good company. He wondered how he had
managed to drive from the opposite side of town as he
attempted to wipe the sleep from his eyes. Failing that, he
scanned the expansive room for his companions. The whole
point of arriving at school early, he thought, was to talk
with friends before another day of torture. Now, without a
single acquaintance in sight, his entire morning felt pointless.

After trudging down the court sidelines to the bleachers,
he climbed the steps up to his usual spot and found
his seat in the shadows. Passing by a few other tired teens,
a few "hey"s and "hello"s were exchanged in whispers and
grunts. Sitting down, Sky pulled out his phone to check
the time: 7:32am. Ugh. After a long and cold fall break, he
doubted that any of his friends would arrive anytime soon.
Turning from side to side, he noticed that a few others were
lying asleep on the unfilled bleachers, resting quietly in the
shadows. A yawn escaped his mouth, and after half a second of
consideration, he found himself laying on his back
staring into the dim rafters. Slowly, he closed his eyes
and let out a breath.

Instantly, the lights in the gymnasium snapped to life,
dispelling the shadows from the room, much to the audible
displeasure of tired students. Sky slowly sat up,
echoing the groans of others as his blinking eyes adjusted
to his now illuminated surroundings. Looking out over the
lit environment, a patch of green stood out amongst the
purple and gold that covered the interior.

Across the court on the opposite side of the gym, a slender,
blond-haired girl stood right inside a closing doorway. A
short, casual green dress danced around her torso, complemented
by the bluejeans she was wearing underneath. Her mid-length
blond hair was surprisingly well kept despite the cold,
windy conditions outside. Although Sky certainly did
not know every face in the school, he was certain that he
did not recognize her. A strange time to be getting transfers,
he thought.

Leaning back against the step behind him, his eyes drifted
closed for a brief moment of rest. When he pried them
open once more, much to his surprise, the mystery girl he
had seen before was sitting two rows below him. How
long had he been out? Looking from side to side, the building
seemed every bit as empty as it had before he had closed
his eyes. Without much thought, Sky dug into his pocket
for his smartphone to check the time. A puzzled look crossed
his face as he took in the time: 7:35am. How strange, he thought
as he slid his phone back into his pocket.

Another sigh escaped his mouth as he realized that school
would not be starting for almost thirty minutes. Perfectly typical
of an unoccupied high school student, Sky began searching
the room for something interesting. As his eyes scanned, he
continued to arrive back at the same item: the mystery girl seated
five feet ahead of him. For a moment, his eyes stopped to examine
the new girl. This time, something new caught his eye: a beautiful
white flower corsage encircling her right wrist. Unlike the
accessories worn at the annual school formal, this corsage
seemed perfect in all respects. White petals, pure as fresh snow,
covered the creation. Beneath them, they seemed anchored not to a
bracelet but to vines wound over her skin. It was truly a sight
to behold.

"What a beautiful corsage," he muttered to himself.

The mystery girl's head perked up and she turned to face him.
Oh man, I didn't mean to say that out loud, he thought. "Mystery
Girl" turned out to be a pretty, well-kept, and altogether
average girl with blue eyes. Unlike the others in the building, a
pleasant expression adorned her face and her lips formed a
soft smile.

"Oh, did you say something?"

"I was just looking at your corsage," he responded, caught off
guard but trying to play it down. "That _is_ what it is, right?"

"Mhmm!" she confirmed with a smile. "Do you like it?"

Sky smiled as he responded,  "It's beautiful to say the
absolute least. And even _that_ might be an understatement. Where
did you get it?"

Beaming with pride, mystery girl announced, "I made it myself!
I absolutely love flowers!" With that she held her wrist out
for him to see. "Here, have a look."

Upon closer inspection, the corsage seemed even more amazing. The
flowers, bright and pure, were unwilted, as if they had forgotten
that they had been cut. Hidden beneath the petals was a silver
band, barely visible given the stems and vines wrapped around it.
Truly, this was a work of craftsmanship. Sky sat for a moment
enchanted and in sheer awe of the treasure.

"So.... What do you think?"

It took a second for him to snap back into reality. "It's absolutely
amazing! How did you manage to make this?" he asked.

"What can I say, I love flowers and I'm good at what I do," the
mystery girl said with a smile and an air of mystery.

Placing her hand back on her lap, a brief moment of silence ensued.
"Oh," something occurred to him. "I never did get your name. My
name is Sky," he said, offering his hand forward.

A warm, strong hand grasped his in turn as the bell rang overhead.
"I'm Cayce," the mystery girl named herself, "and it's been very
nice talking with you. Maybe I'll see you later!"

As the countless students around them streamed down the bleachers
and out of the building, he sat confused. "I'm looking
forward to it," he said softly, perplexed by the situation.

"Have a great day!" Cayce announced as she hefted her backpack onto
her shoulder and turned to join the exiting crowd. As she turned to
leave Sky looked down at his phone: 8:01am.

When he turned his head up to respond, she was gone.
