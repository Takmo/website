After three years of dreaming about a website, and more recently,
six months of allowing my domain to collect dust, I've finally set
up a website!

Although I'm not entirely sure what sorts of treasures this
domain may hold in the future, I look forward to a bright future
and hopefully a multitude of future posts!
