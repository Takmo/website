*For anyone who may be interested, this is the Valedictorian Address that I
presented at my high school graduation on Saturday, June 7th, 2014.*

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today...

Wait... This is *not* the right script... Here we go...

Good morning classmates, friends, family, teachers, faculty, administration, and esteemed guests. It is both 
an honor and a pleasure to stand before you today on behalf of the Graduating Class 
of 2014. I would like to begin by relaying the unspoken thought that has been dancing around the heads of 
every candidate on this stage. 

"We made it."

I have the immense honor of sharing this stage with some of the kindest, brightest, and most amazing 
people I have had the pleasure of knowing. My buddy Josh is here too! In most graduating classes, one 
can rarely claim to know more than a handful of their fellow classmates. My high school has truly 
blessed me with the opportunity to befriend every member of my class, a privilege that only students at the 
elite 1A classification level understand. 

Our class has shared many great and unforgettable memories together. The football games under the 
friday night lights, the spontaneous barber shop quartets that appeared at the most hilarious of times, the 
time I *ahem* completely wrecked everyone at laser tag. These are some of the fondest memories of my 
life so far. Of course, there are memories that I'm not quite as fond of, such as the time I made Josh laugh 
at the lunch table and found myself wearing mashed potatoes. Thank you Josh for that emotional scarring. 

After all of the times and memories we have shared together, we are finally all gathered together on one 
last formal occasion to celebrate our grand entrance into the world. Each student present today is 
prepared for the world awaiting them at the conclusion of this ceremony. Well, as prepared as anyone can 
be at their commencement. 

Seated before you today are the artists and authors who will inspire us for decades to come, the nurses 
and medical professionals who will attend to and comfort us in our times of trouble, the airmen and 
marines who will serve valiantly when our nation is in need, the engineers and mechanics who will keep 
our society operational, the missionaries who will travel both near and far to minister to the lost, the 
teachers who will empower the next generation, and the individuals who will leave an impact on the world 
around them.

Our entire lives have not been leading up to this moment, but rather to the world after it. Our 
commencement today is a proclamation to the world of our success in school and our readiness to join 
society proper. Numerous pieces have contributed to our overall success during these years in the Texas 
public school system, but none of us can claim to be here by our hard work and determination alone. No 
one is truly selfmade. We are defined by the relationships we share with those around us. As we 
celebrate our success today, we look out to everyone in this room with gratitude for everything you have 
done in our lives. We owe our success today to you.

There are, of course, specific people who have been involved in our life that deserve our recognition and 
our thanks. I would like to take this time to recognize those we have sorely depended on who have made 
us who we are today.

First and above all else, we owe our thanks to God the Father, our Creator, who has shaped us, guided us, 
and allowed for the paths we have taken thus far in life. We also owe a debt to Jesus Christ, who offered 
the world salvation in the ultimate act of selfsacrificial love. 

Next we owe our thanks to our parents. Not only to our biological mothers and fathers, but to all of the 
ones who took us in and gave us the parental love and guidance we needed in life. You have always been 
there for us, raising us, guiding us, and most importantly, loving us. We have depended on you for so much 
for as long as we can remember, and although you were hoping graduation would get us out of your hair, I 
am happy to inform you that we will always be looking to you for your love and whatever small bills you 
happen to have in your pocket. We have become the people we are today because of the love and 
guidance you have given us. In the same way that we stand here today celebrating our success, we also 
celebrate yours. Thank you so much for loving us, and even if you can't tell, behind all of the complaints 
and arguing, we love you every bit as much. 

Our teachers also deserve our thanks. After putting up with us for so long, they probably also deserve a 
party, a bonus, and a three month long vacation. We truly owe our teachers so much. All of them have 
been more than simple instructors. While they certainly taught their respective subjects well, they also 
taught us life lessons that you would be hardpressed to find in a textbook. Our teachers have been our 
mentors when we needed guidance, our coaches when we needed practice, our rescuers when we found 
ourselves in over our heads, and our friends when we needed someone to talk to. From the bottom of our 
hearts, we wish to extend our gratitude to all of our teachers present today. Thank you so much for your 
hard work and your involvement in our lives.

Finally, we owe our thanks to our friends and classmates. No one can understand your life better than the 
ones who are living it with you. We have relied on our friends for everything over the years. It is always 
our friends who keep us smiling throughout the days, who keep us laughing at the funniest of jokes, who 
keep us going during the darkest of times. Thanks for being there with us along the way, thank you for the 
fun times, and thank you for making a difference in our lives. 

Before we take our final steps as high school students, as per tradition, I would like to offer some words of 
wisdom, if you would call them that, to my classmates. I offer this not simply as advice, but as a challenge 
to each of my friends.

Never put off something that is important to you, because you never know what the future may hold. This 
rings especially true with your relationships with friends and family and your
life's dreams. If you truly 
care about something, it needs to take priority in your life. Don't wait to start following your dreams, start 
living them out now. To quote Dolly Parton, "Don't get so busy making a living that you forget to make a 
life." Right now we have our whole lives ahead of us, but we won't always. Don't
wait until you're 
successful, don't wait until you're retired, don't wait until you're at the end of your life. Start making your 
dreams come true now. 

Always strive for perfection, even when you know that it's out of reach. If our only goal in life is to be 
"good enough", we never will be. By giving our best in everything, we constantly improve both ourselves
and the world around us. Never settle for "good enough", aim for perfection and be happy with what you 
achieve.

Never let your failures keep you down, but rather allow them to inspire you. Failures are inevitable in life, 
but they serve an important purpose: they help us to to learn and grow as
individuals. If we aren't failing at 
least some of the time, we probably aren't improving either. The failures we encounter in our lives define 
our boundaries and show us exactly where we need to be pushing our limits. We can choose to let our 
defeats overcome us, or we can choose to learn from them, grow stronger, and keep moving forward. 

Finally, remember to speak kindly to those around you. We all know what it feels like to be treated 
wrongly, and these are certainly not ideas we need to perpetuate. Because, of course, I had to include a 
nerd quote, in the words of Gandalf the Gray, "I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that 
keep the darkness at bay... small acts of kindness and love." Words have unimaginable power behind 
them, and a single kind phrase could earn you respect, inspire another soul, or even save a life. If we truly 
wish to see the world become a better place, it begins with how we treat one another. Speak kindly to 
those around you, because you never know who may be listening or the difference a single act of kindness 
could make. 

For myself, today is not a day of sadness, but a day of excitement.We have shared many amazing 
memories together that none of us will ever forget. But looking ahead, our lives are before us and it's time 
to make new memories. It's time to begin the rest of our life and step out into the world with confidence. 
My final challenge to you is this: as we depart from this ceremony and go out into the world, make new 
memories, make a difference in the lives of those around you, and start making your dreams come true. 

Congratulations, Class of 2014. We made it. Now let's see where we go from here.
