The dawn of a new year has always been a symbol of
renewal; the passing away of an era, be it good
or bad, and the hope of a better year ahead. For myself,
it is a time to reflect upon memories and begin planning
for the future.

This year has been been filled with ups and downs for
myself, much as it has been for everyone. Numerous
accomplishments linger in my mind, alongside memories
that shall inspire me for years to come. Life was not
without its troubles, though. Longtime friendships
have been torn asunder, I have watched comrades face
the darkest points in their lives, and there were many
instances when the pressures of life felt almost too great.
It has been the best of times, it has been the worst of
times, and I would never trade it away.

With the past behind me, a new year approaches with
the allure of a bright future. Twenty-fourteen marks
the year of my high school graduation and my entrance
into the university of my dreams. A new chapter in my
life begins at midnight tonight, promising to be the
most exciting one yet.

To say that I am enthusiastic about the new year would be
a terrible understatement. Maybe my visions are
over-romanticized, but nonetheless, I have high
expectations for this upcoming year. At the very least,
it shall be nothing short of life changing; at the very
best, this may turn out to be the greatest year of my
life thusfar.

If I were to say that the next year will be exciting and
leave it at that, I would certainly be forgetting another
side to the story. As amazing as the upcoming year appears to
be, there is a great deal of uncertainty and fear in my
future. I am afraid of leaving high school, I am afraid to
leave the home I know, and I am afraid of what life may
hold. But amidst all of the uncertainty, amidst all of the
fear, I know that the new year will bring a vast number of new
experiences and paint a beautiful collection of new memories.
Although I may be nervous while stepping into a brave new
world, I eagerly await another one of life's many adventures.

As an almost cliche conclusion to this post, an inspection
of the previous year would be incomplete without a few goals
to work towards in the next twelve months. In no particular
order, my objectives for the next chapter are as follows:

* Read more books.
* Finish making a game. Like a good one.
* Phase out a few unhealthy habits.
* Replace them with a few healthier ones.
* Get an actual job and earn actual money.
* Be a better brother.
* Make new friends.
* Contribute to an open source project.
* Survive my first real college semester.
* Make a positive difference in the world.

A lofty set of goals, to be sure, but I look forward to
working on them as the year progresses. Here's to the next
twelve months!

End of year.
