## Howdy, friend.

My name is Randall. I am a 21 year old student from a small town in Texas. A
sinner saved by grace. I currently reside in College Station, Texas, where I
work as a Software Developer and pursue my studies in both Computer Science
and Music at Texas A&M University.

Professional interest areas: distributed computing, web-scale systems,
human-computer interaction, educational games, interactive/responsive media,
and music technology.

Noteworthy pastimes: music (listening,
performing, and arranging), coding, GNU/Linux, writing, video games (playing
and developing), and tabletop roleplaying.

## Developing software is what I do.

When I do, it typically ends up on my [Github](https://github.com/takmo).
I cannot promise greatness, but every project there brought me here. Everything
is licensed openly, so you can build on something if you want.

## I take pride in my work.

This summer's adventure has been with Facebook Seattle, where I was employed
as a Production Engineer Intern developing a pipeline diagnostics tool,
broadening existing logging facilities, and learning as much as I could about
how Facebook reliably serves over 2-billion monthly active users.

During the 2016-2017 academic year, I worked as a Test Automation Developer
for a local web-service company, building test automation systems for our web
applications, standardizing our testing infrastructure, and safeguarding
software quality for our customers. I will resume my role here in September.

Throughout the Summer of 2016, I worked as a Software Developer Intern at
Microsoft, helping to develop enterprise business solution platforms in
[#TheCloud](https://azure.microsoft.com).

During Summer of 2015 I worked as a Software Developer Intern at [Epoch Labs]
(http://epochlabs.com), contributing to a high-performance distributed
NoSQL database with a whimsical love of [boats](https://raft.github.io/).

Before my current employment, I worked four semesters as a Student Technician
for the Engineering IT group at Texas A&M University, where I interacted daily
with students, staff, and faculty to resolve technical mishaps and maintain
equipment and services.

## Sometimes, I write things.

I am not one for blogging, but sometimes I have something to say. Here are a
few of my latest posts.
